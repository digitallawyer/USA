##Founder Collaboration Agreement

The undersigned (each a “Founder” and together the “Founders”) are collaborating with the purpose of developing together a business concept related to 

**[DESCRIBE BUSINESS CONCEPT HERE]** and related technology (the “Business Concept and Technology”) which, if developed, will be transferred to and launched by a company to be formed by the Founders (the “Company”). 

In connection with such collaboration, and in consideration for a mutually agreeable framework which shall serve as the foundation for the Founders to successfully develop the Business Concept and Technology, the undersigned hereby agree as follows:

###1.  TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP TO COMPANY UPON FORMATION

Section 1.1	Each Founder shall grant and assign to the Company immediately upon its formation all of his or her right, title, and interest in and to the Business Concept and Technology (including all right, title and interest to intellectual property thereto), including all ideas (however formed or unformed) and labor and/or work product that results from any task or work performed by the Founder that relates to the Business Concept or Technology for the full term of such rights. Each Founder shall also perform all such acts and execute all such further documents and instruments as may be required by the Company that are necessary or desirable to vest absolute legal and beneficial ownership of the Business Concept and Technology and any related intellectual property in the Company. 

Section 1.2	Any other agreement that requires an ownership interest in the Business Concept and Technology and related intellectual property to be transferred to a third party before the formation of the Company must be agreed upon by each Founder. In the event of such an agreement, the obligations of this Founder Collaboration Agreement must be disclosed to that third party.

Section 1.3	For purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall be considered formed upon registration and recognition of a business entity by the Secretary of State of any state, including but not limited to registration and recognition of a limited liability company or any form of corporation.

###2.	OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE UPON FORMATION

Section 2.1	Upon formation of the Company, the entire issued share ownership of the Company will be split 

**[DESCRIBE SPLIT OF COMPANY, e.g., “equally,” “10 percent to Founder A,” etc.]**, but in all instances shall be reached by consensus of the Founders. Any portion reserved for a share option pool will dilute all Founders equally.

Section 2.2	The shares issued to each Founder shall be on a vesting schedule so that if any Founder’s relationship with the Company terminates for any reason prior to full vesting of all shares entitled to the Founder, the remaining portion of any unvested shares shall be returned to the Company in accordance with that vesting schedule.

Section 2.3	If holders of the majority of the shares in the Company wish to sell the Company to a third party, they shall have the right to require the other shareholders of the Company to sell their shares to such third party on the same terms.

###3.	CONFIDENTIALITY

Section 3.1	The Founders agree to keep the Business Concept and Technology confidential; disclosure of the Business Concept and Technology will occur only on an as-needed basis and only upon consent of all Founders. Notwithstanding such unanimous consensual disclosures, the Founders shall take all necessary steps to keep the Business Concept and Technology confidential until the formation of the Company, at which time the Founders shall further detail and define any confidentiality obligations. 

###4.	CONTRACTUAL COMMUNICATION AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Section 4.1	Within **[DEFINE LENGTH OF TIME, e.g., “one month,” “six months,” “one year”]** of signature, if the Founders have not yet formed a Company, the Founders agree to discuss the benefits of continued collaboration related to the Business Concept and Technology and will discuss a mutually agreeable timetable for the formation of the Company. 

Section 4.2	In the event that the Founders do not wish to continue their mutual collaboration, the Founders shall discuss a mutually agreeable separation and division of assets of their collaboration. The Founders shall further define any and all confidentiality obligations related to the Business Concept and Technology. Consistent with Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16600, et seq., in no circumstance shall the underlying business concept be considered confidential upon termination of this Agreement.  

Section 4.3	In the event that the Founders are not able to agree to a mutually agreeable separation, the Founders agree that they will submit to a binding confidential mediation to be held in San Francisco, California and conducted by a mutually agreed to mediator. The Founders agree and acknowledge that all provisions of this agreement, including confidentiality provisions, shall be binding up through the end of this mediation process. Costs of the mediation shall be borne equally by all Founders. The Founders hereby waive any all right to have this agreement adjudicated by a court or jury.

###5.	REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Section 5.1	Each Founder hereby represents and warrants that he or she is not a party to any agreement or arrangement which would restrict such Founder’s ability to perform its obligations as set forth above and that no third party can claim any rights to the Business Concept and Technology which may be developed by each Founder.

###6.	CHOICE OF LAW

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with California law.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Founders have signed this Agreement on
